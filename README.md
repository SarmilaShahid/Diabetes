Problem Statement (Diabetes):

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a serious and growing global health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The traditional diagnosis methods involve costly, time-consuming, and often invasive procedures. This web application aims to provide a simple, data-driven tool that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several health metrics, including glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and age.

Demo Web App Details
For the demo of the web app, you can showcase how users interact with the model:
1.	Input: Users enter health data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, insulin levels, etc.
2.	Prediction: The machine learning model processes the inputs and predicts whether the user is at risk for diabetes.
3.	User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI built using Streamlit.
Project Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Web App is designed to predict the risk of diabetes using machine learning models. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to input their health parameters and receive an instant prediction

Project Introduction (My View)
In my view, this project leverages machine learning to address a significant healthcare problem: the early detection of diabetes.

Requirements
Below is a list of requirements for your Diabetes Prediction Web App:
â€¢	Frontend: Streamlit
â€¢	Backend: Python
â€¢	Libraries:
o	Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model.
o	Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.
o	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations (optional).
Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future enhancements:
1.	Feature Expansion: Add additional features such as family medical history and lifestyle data (e.g., smoking habits, physical activity).
2.	More Models: Incorporate advanced models like XGBoost, SVM, or even deep learning approaches like CNNs.
3.	Mobile App: Build a mobile version of the web app for better accessibility.
